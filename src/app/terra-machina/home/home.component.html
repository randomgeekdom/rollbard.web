                and myth advances beyond its ages of primitivity, agriculture,

                technology. Life transpires on the spectrum of science and
                sorcery. It is a world where the gods of the machine coexist

              Terra Machina is a tabletop RPG based loosely on Dungeon World by
              Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel. It imagines a Tolkienesque world
              where time has passed to the point where technology is just as
              powerful as magic. Taking inspiration from Japanese roleplaying
              video games of the 32-bit era, it is a unique experience that
              hopes to combine the best elements of science fiction, fantasy,
              and action.
